Enjoy!

My Readme  
---------  
This version uses a NoIR camera module and some tweaks.  
I also used a different 3D printed case because I am using a Raspberry Pi B+ with the capacitive PiTFT 2.8.  
  
I combined this [camera case](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:92208) with this [PiTFT case](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:802232).
  
Also added portable power.
